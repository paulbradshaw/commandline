# Counting words, lines and characters in command line: `wc` and `Measure-Object`

If you have a large data file and want to know how many rows it has, command line is a quick way to do that.

On Mac/Linux the relevant command is `wc` (think 'word count'); [on Windows PowerShell it is `Measure-Object`](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176900.aspx)
