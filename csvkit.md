# csvkit

**csvkit** is a set of tools you can use in your command line to convert, interrogate and create CSV files (spreadsheets). 

You can [find the documentation online here](http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/540/) but first you need to install it, using this line in Terminal:

`pip install csvkit`

One of the most powerful elements of csvkit is its ability to run **SQL queries** on CSV files [using csvsql and sql2csv](http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/540/tutorial/3_power_tools.html#csvsql-and-sql2csv-ultimate-power)
