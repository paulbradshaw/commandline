<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>7.A person who is neither a British citizen nor a Commonwealth citizen with the right of abode nor a person who is entitled to enter or remain in the United Kingdom by virtue of the provisions of the 2006 EEA Regulations requires leave to enter the United Kingdom.</li>
  <li>8.Under Sections 3 and 4 of the Immigration Act 1971 an Immigration Officer when admitting  to the United Kingdom a person subject to immigration control under that Act may give leave to enter for a limited period and, if he does, may impose all or any of the following conditions:

Channel Tunnel, produce on request by the Immigration Officer:
    <ol>
      <li>(i) a valid national passport or other document satisfactorily establishing his identity and nationality; and</li>

    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pt1requirementleave">Requirement for a person not requiring leave to enter the United Kingdom to prove that he has the right of abode</h2>

<ol class="legislative-list">

<h2 id="pt1commontravel">Common Travel Area</h2>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>15.The United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland 
collectively form a common travel area. A person who has been examined for the purpose of  immigration control at the point at which he entered the area does not normally require leave to enter any other part of it. However certain persons subject to the Immigration (Control of Entry through the Republic of Ireland) Order 1972 (as amended) who enter the United Kingdom through the Republic of Ireland do require leave to enter. This includes:
    <ol>
      <li>(i) those who merely passed through the Republic of Ireland;</li>
      <li>(ii)persons requiring visas;</li>
      <li>(iii)persons who entered the Republic of Ireland unlawfully;</li>

there unlawfully or overstaying their leave.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>16. A person in any of the following categories may be admitted freely to the United Kingdom on production of a United Kingdom passport issued in the United Kingdom and Islands or the

    <ol>
      <li>(i) a British Dependent Territories citizen;</li>
      <li>(ii) _a British National (Overseas);</li>
      <li>(iii) _a British Overseas citizen;</li>
      <li>(iv) _a British protected person;</li>
      <li>(v) a British subject by virtue of Section 30(a) of the British Nationality Act 1981, (who, immediately before the commencement of the 1981 Act would have been a British subject not 
possessing citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies or the citizenship of any other Commonwealth country or territory).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>17. British Overseas citizens who hold United Kingdom passports wherever issued and who 
satisfy the Immigration Officer that they have, since 1 March 1968, been given indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom may be given indefinite leave to enter.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pt1personoutside">Persons outside the United Kingdom</h2>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>17A. Where a person is outside the United Kingdom but wishes to travel to the United Kingdom an Immigration Officer may give or refuse him leave to enter. An Immigration Officer may exercise these powers whether or not he is, himself, in the United Kingdom. However, an Immigration Officer is not obliged to consider an application for leave to enter from a person outside the United Kingdom.</li>
  <li>17B. Where a person having left the common travel area, has leave to enter the United 
Kingdom which remains in force under article 13 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and 
Remain) Order 2000, an Immigration Officer may cancel that leave. An Immigration Officer may exercise these powers whether or not he is, himself, in the United Kingdom. If a person 
outside the United Kingdom has leave to remain in the United Kingdom which is in force in 
this way, the Secretary of State may cancel that leave.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pt1returningresident">Returning Residents</h2>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>18. A person seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom as a returning resident may be 
admitted for settlement provided the Immigration Officer is satisfied that the person concerned:
    <ol>
      <li>(i) had indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom when he last left; and</li>
      <li>(ii) has not been away from the United Kingdom for more than 2 years; and</li>
      <li>(iii) did not receive assistance from public funds towards the cost of leaving the United Kingdom; and</li>
      <li>(iv) now seeks admission for the purpose of settlement.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>18A. Those who qualify for admission to the United Kingdom as returning residents in accordance with paragraph 18 do not need a visa to enter the UK.</li>
  <li>19. A person who does not benefit from the preceding paragraph by reason only of having been away from the United Kingdom too long may nevertheless be admitted as a returning resident if, for example, he has lived here for most of his life.</li>
  <li>19A. Sub paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 18 shall not apply where a person who has indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom accompanies on an overseas posting, a spouse, civil partner, unmarried partner or same-sex partner who is: </li>
  <li>a) a member of HM Forces serving overseas; or </li>
  <li>b) a British citizen or is settled in the UK and

      <li>(ii) a comparable United Kingdom based staff member of the British Council;</li>
      <li>( iii) a staff member of the Department for International Development; or</li>
      <li>(iv) a Home Office employee.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>20.The leave of a person whose stay in the United Kingdom is subject to a time limit lapses on his going to a country or territory outside the common travel area if the leave was given for a period of six months or less or conferred by a visit visa. In other cases, leave lapses on the holder remaining outside the United Kingdom for a continuous period of more than two years. A person whose leave has lapsed and who returns after a temporary absence abroad within the period of this earlier leave has no claim to admission as a returning resident. His application to re-enter the United Kingdom should be considered in the light of all the relevant circumstances. The same time limit and any conditions attached will normally be reimposed if he meets the requirements of these Rules, unless he is seeking admission in a different capacity from the one in which he was last given leave to enter or remain.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pt1nonlapsing">Non-lapsing leave</h2>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>20A. Leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom will usually lapse on the holder going to a country or territory outside the common travel area. However, under article 13 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 such leave will not lapse where it was 
given for a period exceeding six months or where it was conferred by means of an entry 
clearance (other than a visit visa).</li>
  <li>20B. Those who seek leave to enter the United Kingdom within the period of their earlier leave and for the same purpose as that for which that leave was granted, unless it
    <ol>

<h2 id="pt1restrictedtravel">Holders of restricted travel documents and passports</h2>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>21. The leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom of the holder of a passport or travel 
document whose permission to enter another country has to be exercised before a given date may be restricted so as to terminate at least 2 months before that date.</li>
  <li>22. If his passport or travel document is endorsed with a restriction on the period for 
which he may remain outside his country of normal residence, his leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom may be limited so as not to extend beyond the period of authorised absence.</li>
  <li>23.The holder of a travel document issued by the Home Office should not be given leave to 
enter or remain for a period extending beyond the validity of that document. This paragraph and paragraphs 21-22 do not apply to a person who is eligible for admission for settlement or to a spouse or civil partner who is eligible for admission under paragraph 282 or to a person who qualifies for the removal of the time limit on his stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>
    <p>23A.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>23B.

  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pt1entryclearance">Entry clearance</h2>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>24.The following must produce to the Immigration Officer a valid passport or other identity document endorsed with a United Kingdom entry clearance issued to him for the purpose for which he seeks entry:
    <ol>
      <li>(i)	a visa national; </li>
      <li>(ii) a non visa national who is:
        <ol>
          <li>(a) not a British national; and</li>
          <li>(b) seeking entry for a period exceeding six months or for a purpose for which prior entry clearance is required under these Rules;</li>

    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Such a person will be refused leave to enter if he has no such current entry clearance. Any other person who wishes to ascertain in advance whether he is eligible for admission to the United Kingdom may apply for the issue of an entry clearance.</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>25. Entry clearance takes the form of a visa (for visa nationals) or an entry certificate (for non visa nationals). These documents are to be taken as evidence of the holder’s eligibility for entry into the United Kingdom, and accordingly accepted as “entry clearances” within the meaning of the Immigration Act 1971.</li>
  <li>25A. An entry clearance which satisfies the requirements set out in article 3 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 will have effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom. The requirements are that the entry clearance must specify the purpose for which the holder wishes to enter the United Kingdom and should be endorsed with the conditions to which it is subject or wish a statement that it has effect as indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom. The holder of such an entry clearance will not require leave to enter on arrival in the United Kingdom and, for the purposes of these Rules, will be treated as a person who has arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to enter the United Kingdom which is in force but which was given to him before his arrival.</li>
  <li>26. An application for entry clearance will be considered in accordance with the provisions in these Rules governing the grant or refusal of leave to enter. Where appropriate, the term “Entry Clearance Officer” should be substituted for “Immigration Officer”.</li>
  <li>
    <p>27. An application for entry clearance is to be decided in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of the decision, except that an applicant will not be refused an entry clearance where entry is sought in one of the categories contained in paragraphs 296-316 <em>or paragraph EC-C of Appendix FM</em> solely on account of his attaining the age of 18 years between receipt of his application and the date of the decision on it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>28. An applicant for an entry clearance must be outside the United Kingdom and Islands at the time of the application. An application for an entry clearance as a visitor or as a short-term student must be made to any post designated by the Secretary of State to accept such applications. Subject to paragraph 28A, any other application must be made to a post in the country or territory where the applicant is living which has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications for entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant. Where there is no such post the applicant must apply to the appropriate designated post outside the country or territory where he is living.</p>
  </li>
  <li>28A (a) An application for entry clearance as a Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Migrant in the creative and sporting sub-category of Tier 5 may also be made at the post in the country or 
territory where the applicant is situated at the time of the application, provided that:
    <ol>
      <li>(i) the post has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications for entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant,</li>
      <li>(ii) the applicant is in that country or territory for a similar purpose to the activity he proposes to undertake in the UK, and</li>
      <li>(iii) the applicant is able to demonstrate to the Entry Clearance Officer that he has authority to be living in that country or territory in accordance with its immigration laws. Those applicants who are known to the authorities of that country or territory but who have not been given permission to live in that country or territory will not be eligible to make an application.</li>
      <li>(b) An application for entry clearance as a Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent) Migrant or as a Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme) Temporary Migrant may also be made at the post in the country or territory where the applicant is situated at the time of the application, provided that:
        <ol>
          <li>(i) the post has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications for entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant, and</li>
          <li>(ii) the applicant is able to demonstrate to the Entry Clearance Officer that he has authority to be living in that country or territory in accordance with its immigration laws and that when he was given authority to live in that country or territory he was given authority to live in that country or territory for a period of more than 6 months. Those applicants who are known to the authorities of that country or territory but who have not been given permission to live in that country or territory will not be eligible to make an application.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>29. For the purposes of paragraph 28 “post” means a British Diplomatic Mission, British Consular post or the office of any person outside the United Kingdom and Islands who has been authorised by the Secretary of State to accept applications for entry clearance. A list of designated posts is published by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</li>
  <li>30. An application for an entry clearance is not made until any fee required to be paid under the regulations made under sections 68 and 69 of the Immigration Act 2014 has been paid.</li>
  <li>30A. An entry clearance may be revoked if the Entry Clearance Officer is satisfied that:
    <ol>
      <li>(i) whether or not to the holder’s knowledge, false representations were employed or material facts were not disclosed, either in writing or orally, for the purpose of obtaining the entry clearance; or</li>
      <li>(ii) a change of circumstances since the entry clearance was issued has removed the basis of the holder’s claim to be admitted to the United Kingdom, except where the change of circumstances amounts solely to his exceeding the age for entry in one of the categories contained in paragraphs 296-316 of these Rules since the issue of the entry clearance; or</li>
      <li>(iii) the holder’s exclusion from the United Kingdom would be conducive to the public good.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>30B. An entry clearance shall cease to have effect where the entry clearance has effect as leave to enter and an Immigration Officer cancels that leave in accordance with paragraph 2A(8) of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971.</li>
  <li>30C. An Immigration Officer may cancel an entry clearance which is capable of having effect 
as leave to enter if the holder arrives in the United Kingdom before the day on which the entry clearance becomes effective or if the holder seeks to enter the United Kingdom for a purpose other than the purpose specified in the entry clearance.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pt1variation">Variation of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom</h2>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>31. Under Section 3(3) of the 1971 Act a limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom may be varied by extending or restricting its duration, by adding, varying or revoking conditions or by removing the time limit (where upon any condition attached to the leave ceases to apply). When leave to enter or remain is varied an entry is to be made in the applicant’s passport or travel document (and his registration certificate where appropriate) or the decision may be made known in writing in some other appropriate way.</li>
  <li>31A. Where a person has arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom which is in force but was given to him before his arrival, he may apply, on arrival at the port of entry in the United Kingdom, for variation of that leave. An Immigration Officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State may vary the leave at the port of entry but is not obliged to consider an application for variation made at the port of entry. If an Immigration Officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State has declined to consider an application for variation of leave at a port of entry but the leave has not been cancelled under paragraph 2A(8) of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971, the person seeking variation should apply to the Home Office under paragraph 32.</li>

<h2 id="pt1medical">Medical</h2>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>36. A person who intends to remain in the United Kingdom for more than 6 months should normally be referred to the Medical Inspector for examination.

Any person seeking entry who mentions health or medical treatment as a reason for his visit, or who appears not to be in good mental or physical health, should also be referred to the Medical Inspector; and the Immigration Officer has discretion, which should be exercised sparingly, to refer for examination in any other case.</li>
  <li>37. Where the Medical Inspector advises that a person seeking entry is suffering from a specified disease or condition which may interfere with his ability to support himself or his dependants, the Immigration Officer should take account of this, in conjunction with other factors, in deciding whether to admit that person. The Immigration Officer should also take account of the Medical Inspector’s assessment of the likely course of treatment in deciding whether a person seeking entry for private medical treatment has sufficient means at his disposal.</li>
  <li>38. A returning resident should not be refused leave to enter or have existing leave to enter or remain cancelled on medical grounds. But where a person would be refused leave to enter or have existing leave to enter or remain cancelled on medical grounds if he were not a returning resident or in any case where it is decided on compassionate grounds not to exercise the power to refuse leave to enter or to cancel existing leave to enter or remain, or in any other case where the Medical Inspector so recommends, the Immigration Officer should give the person concerned a notice requiring him to report to the Medical Officer of Environmental Health designated by the Medical Inspector with a view to further examination and any necessary treatment.</li>

Where a person has lawfully been present in a country not mentioned in Appendix T for more than six months and they are applying for entry clearance as in A39 in a country in Appendix T but have not been in that country or any other country mentioned in Appendix T for more than six months immediately before making their application, they will not be required to produce a medical certificate showing they are free from active pulmonary TB. This does not alter the discretionary powers as in paragraph 39 below.</li>
