# Using SQL queries within Terminal

You can create and query SQLite databases in the command line using **sqlite3**. Just type:

`sqlite3`

And you can start using commands: you'll notice that the prompt changes to `sqlite>` to reflect this.

[Instructions on how to use this are available here](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html)

To quit sqlite3 press CTRL+D on the keyboard.
